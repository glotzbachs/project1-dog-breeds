# DogBreeds

Welcome to your Furry Friend Finder! This program will help you find out more about the top rated dogs, as ranked by AKC(American Kennel Club). Hopefully it can help you find out which dog will be the best new addition to your family.

This is my first project as part of flatiron school. Please, long time coders, don't think this is meant to be top level work.

To run this file, use `./bin/dog_breeds`. 

Licensing can be found in the files associated with this project.

Thank you Nancy Noyes, Avi Flombaum, and all the students in my 10/07/19 cohort for help and support. Although not around for help in this particular project, special shout out to the Ask a Question team for their support as well.
